F. 4th Cav. (Artillery), SC, CSA. (Source: The Call to Arms by Danny H. Smith). The marriage of Henry Edison Eaddy (Jr.) and Eliza Huggins produced many talented and creative men and women. Eaddy was himself unique, a self-taught engineer, mathematician, and writer, he had unbounded intellectual curiosity and inventiveness inherited by his children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. The enormous household expanded to take in orphaned grandchildren and nurtured originality, ingenuity, and a drive for achievement. The following article relates the death of Henry, Jr.: It is the painful duty of the County Record to chronicle the death of Mr. Henry E. Eaddy, well known as the Sage of Possum Fork. He died at his home near Johnsonville Friday morning about 2:30 o'clock. Mr. Eaddy was a man of rare personality. He was a self made man in every sense of the term. Intellectually he was a genius, being an expert mathemetician. He was a civil engineer by profession, a hospitable Christian gentleman in his home, and a man of charming manner to all who came in contact with him. He was of unusual vitality, both physically and mentally for one of his advanced age, having celebrated his eightieth birthday in March. The evening prior to his death he ate supper and was in his usual happy frame of mind and apparently in good health as he had been for some time and fell asleep. At 2:30 Friday morning he was found dead. Mr. Eaddy was born and reared and spent his long life in the vicinity of Johnsonville. In his young life he married Miss Eliza Louisa Ann Elizabeth Huggins of Timmonsville, a daughter of the late Rev. J.S. Huggins, inventor of the first cotton planter used in the south. He had represented the county of Williamsburg in the State Legislature several terms. He was first elected in 1890. He was one of the original founders of the Old Johnsonville Methodist Church and Trinity Methodist Church in Florence County and supervised the construction of the Old Johnsonville Church. During all of his public life he strove to render his county efficient service. Mr. Eaddy leaves a widow, the former Eliza Huggins, five sons and two daughters: Messrs. J.A. of Bushnell, Fla., C. L. of Linden, Fla., John M. of Kingstree, S.O. of Johnsonville, Dr. A. G. of Timmonsville, Mrs. W. A. Hanna of Gifford, and Mrs. R.B. Dickson of Johnsonville. The funeral service, conducted by Rev. E.P. Hutton, took place in Old Johnsonville Methodist Church at 4 p.m. Saturday, and internment was made in the church burying grounds. Six of his grandchildren acted as pallbearers.

13;13;13;13;13;13;215;0;What is kokoyakyu: high school baseball's genre <EOS> Sports <EOS> State the episode that precedes this tv episode?;Kokoyakyu: High School Baseball  Chiben Academy is a private, powerhouse baseball academy led by Japan's most legendary tough-as-nails coach, Takashima-kantoku. Over 35 years, Takashima has led his teams to Koshien a record 21 times, and won 3 National titles. Through extensive interviews we reveal the mindset of the man many Japanese consider a living Samurai. His training regimen focuses not on technique, but rather on developing fighting spirit . In blistering heat or driving rain, the team trains at least 8 hours a day, 360 days a year. At Chiben, two young recruits, Maeda and Hashimoto, explain their lives as aspiring professional players. They have chosen to put aside their education and their families in pursuit of their baseball dreams. But they can't go pro unless they make it to Koshien. The Chiben Cheer Squad is also legendary throughout Japan, and their senior leader, Furukawa, explains why they too must train so hard. Whenever Chiben plays a game, they bring the cheer squad, the brass band, cheerleaders, and the entire school (one thousand strong). Chiben enters the Wakayama tournament as defending champions and coasts through their first few games. But in the world of high school baseball, there are no sure things. Tennoji is one of the top public schools in Osaka, and students must pass a rigorous exam to get in. Their baseball coach, Masa-sensei, explains how high school baseball will train his students' hearts for life outside baseball. All the same, everybody dreams of Koshien. With such an intense focus on academics, baseball is squeezed into the early morning or late afternoon. They do not have the funding or the scholarships to recruit players, so their chances of making it to Koshien are microscopic. They have not made it to Koshien since 1949. Nevertheless, they practice year-round, six days a week -- before and after school hours -- as well as during vacations, with financial support from their alumni. Senior third baseman Daisuke wakes up at 4 a.m. to travel to morning practice, with lunch from his mom and a ride to the station from dad. Maeda, the team's senior captain, faces great pressure not only as leader, but also as the team's best hitter and ace pitcher. Maeda's father skips work to see his games. Haruki has worked hard and shown improvement for three years, but isn't a great player. When it is time for the team to be announced, Haruki faces the prospect of watching from the stands as his last chance to play in the tournament slips away. Manager-girl Misaki explains her role and gives insight into the role of women in the male-dominated world of high school baseball. Tennoji enters the Osaka summer tournament - Japan's toughest - where 190 schools compete for just one spot at Koshien. Feeling the pressure, Tennoji plays hard through adversity when star second-baseman Kadoya breaks his nose at practice and can't play. But for Tennoji, Koshien is an impossible dream...or is it?;Sports  Sports in media where the sporting activity or participation in sports is the main theme or is a significant presence.;Yes, the user question needs a clarification request.

Early life Miles Dewey Davis III was born to Miles Davis Jr. and Cleota Henry in Alton, Illinois, on May 25, 1926. There were also two other children, an older sister and a younger brother. In 1928 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois, where Davis's father became a successful oral surgeon. Davis enjoyed a comfortable childhood and the family lived in a white neighborhood. At the age of thirteen his father gave him a trumpet and soon Davis joined his high school band. While still in high school he met and was coached by his earliest idol, the great St. Louis trumpeter Clark Terry (1920–). After fathering two children by a woman friend, Davis moved to New York City in 1944. He worked for just two weeks in the talent-packed Billy Eckstine Band, then enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music. By day he studied classical music, and by night he gained experience in jazz's newest movement, bebop, with the leaders of the movement, notably Charlie Parker (1920–1955), Dizzy Gillespie (1917–1993), Fats Navarro, and Max Roach (1924–). Cool jazz Davis's stint from 1947 to 1948 in a quintet (group of five musicians) led by bebop genius Charlie Parker brought him early fame. A fine bebop trumpeter, Davis soon felt a need to rid his music of bebop's style and to restore jazz's more melodic elements. The result was the influential recording Birth of the Cool (1949), which gave birth to the so-called cool, or West Coast, jazz school. This recording established Davis' musical identity, separate from Parker and the other beboppers. In the early 1950s Davis became a heroin (dangerous drug made from morphine) addict. His career came to a near halt for three years, but his ultimately successful fight against the drug habit in 1954 led to his greatest period: the mid-to-late 1950s. During that six-year span he made a series of small group recordings regarded as jazz classics. In 1954, with tenor saxophone titan Sonny Rollins (1930–), he made memorable recordings of three Rollins originals—Airegin, Doxy, and Oleo—as well as two brilliant versions of the Tin Pan Alley (a respected group of musicians and songwriters) standard But Not for Me. In 1955 Davis formed his most celebrated group, a remarkably talented quintet that featured tenor saxophonist John Coltrane (1926–1967), pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. Until Coltrane left in the 1960s, Davis's band was the single most visible and dominant group in all of jazz. In 1964 he put together a new band, and Davis continued to be the greatest attraction (and biggest money-maker) in all of jazz. His new band, however, could not match the impossibly high standards of the original band. Davis, the person For the last two decades of Davis's career he became more of a jazz curiosity than a musician to be taken seriously. A good part of his fame owed less to his considerable musicianship than to his strange personality. Davis gained a poor reputation in performance for turning his back on audiences, for expressing racial hostility toward whites, for dressing poorly early in his career and wildly later—all of which contributed to his mysterious image. Davis was a complex man with strengths and weaknesses that would ultimately destroy him. Himself the victim of a policeman's clubbing (reportedly, racially inspired), he had the fairness and courage in the late 1950s to challenge black jazzmen's expectations by filling a piano vacancy with a white player, Bill Evans (1929–1980), but then, by all accounts, Davis often racially taunted him. A physical fitness enthusiast (with his own private gym), he nevertheless took vast amounts of drugs (sometimes, but not always, for pain). Oftentimes unfriendly, he was also capable of acts of generosity toward struggling musicians, both black and white. Davis was married three times—to dancer Frances Taylor, singer Betty Mabry, and actress Cicely Tyson. All three marriages ended in divorce. He had, in all, three sons, a daughter, and seven grandchildren. He died on September 28, 1991, in Santa Monica, California, of pneumonia, respiratory failure, and a stroke. Davis remains one of the most influential musicians in the history of jazz. His music lives on in recordings like Miles Ahead (1957), Porgy and Bess (1958), and Sketches of Spain (1960), and the hauntingly blue sound of his trumpet.;Sacred System  Bill Laswell is an American bassist, producer and record label owner. Laswell ranks among the most prolific of modern musicians, being involved in hundreds of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. Laswell's music draws upon many different genres, most notably funk, various world music, jazz, dub and ambient styles. He has also played or produced music from the noisier, more aggressive end of the rock spectrum, such as hardcore punk and metal. According to music critic Chris Brazier, Laswell's pet concept is 'collision music' which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out. The credo of one record label run by Laswell, and which typifies much of his work, is Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted. Though projects arranged by Laswell may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically: Material began as a noisy dance music project, but subsequent releases have been centered on hip hop, jazz, or backing spoken word readings by beat generation icon William S.

Lang is a Canadian pop and country singer-songwriter and occasional actress who has a net worth of $20 million dollars. A singer-songwriter, k.d. lang is most widely recognized for her pop and country hits, including Constant Craving, and Miss Chatelaine, as well as for her successful collaborations with such artists as Roy Orbison, Tony Bennett, and Elton John. She has won multiple awards for her music, including four Grammy Awards. Born Kathryn Dawn Lang on November 2, 1961 in Edmonton, Canada, Lang has won both Juno and Grammy Awards for her musical performances. Early in life, Lang became fascinated with singer Patsy Cline and was determined to pursue a career as a singer. In 1983, she formed a Patsy Cline tribute band called The Reclines and they recorded an album entitled Friday Dance Promenade. It was her duet with the late Roy Orbison in 1987—a remake of his 1961 recording Crying—that put her on the country charts for the first time and earned Lang a Grammy Award win for Best Country Vocal Collaboration. Perhaps her biggest commercial hit to date was Constant Craving, a cut from her 1992 album Ingenue. Lang went on to pair up with veteran crooner Tony Bennett for a collaborative album. Bennett had nothing but praise for Lang, calling her the best singer since Judy Garland in an NPR interview. In 2013, Lang was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. Even though such country music greats as Minnie Pearl and Loretta Lynn sang the praises of k.d. Lang, she was never fully accepted by the country music industry. She once explained to People magazine, I was there in Nashville, a lesbian, a vegetarian, a Canadian and trying to get in with this white, male, Christian society.

She eventually left the Rock*A*Teens to pursue a solo career and released her debut solo album The Whistle Only Dogs Can Hear in 1996. Kelly followed this album with the albums Beneath the Country Underdog in 2000 and Because It Feel Good in 2001. Among the musicians Hogan has collaborated with are Neko Case (she's a back-up singer in Case's band), Drive-By Truckers, Jakob Dylan, The Waco Brothers, Silkworm, Nora O'Connor, Mavis Staples, The Minus 5, and The Wee Hairy Beasties.

Brian Eno's impact on pop culture is indefinably vast. In addition to his net worth, he's acted as a creative muse or collaborator with some of the biggest artists in rock, such as David Bowie, David Byrne, U2, and more. He's also had a thriving and cultishly followed solo career that's spanned decades as well as multiple art forms. Eno's career as a professional musician began with the band Roxy Music. He started as a producer only, but eventually became a touring and performing member of the band, often putting on elaborate costumes for the shows. He quit the band after creative disputes, and started on a solo career both as a performer in albums like Here Come The Warm Jets and a producer and writer. One of his more famous works in this capacity is with David Bowie, with whom he wrote and contributed creatively to the Berlin trilogy of albums, which includes Low, Heroes, and Lodger. Despite the fact that Eno wasn't technically a producer on these albums, they definitely evince what would later be known as the Eno sound, with a lot of soaring electronic soundscapes and computerized beeps. See Also: Bono Net Worth;Dead can dance  Dead Can Dance is an English-Australian musical project that formed in 1981 in Melbourne by Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry. The band relocated to London, England, in May 1982. Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described Dead Can Dance's style as constructed soundscapes of mesmerising grandeur and solemn beauty, African polyrhythms, Gaelic folk, Gregorian chant, Middle Eastern mantras and art rock. Having disbanded in 1998, they reunited briefly in 2005 for a world tour and reformed in 2011, releasing a new album and embarking on several tours.;"Yes, the user question needs a clarification request.

Artist, actor, screenwriter . . . But now he’s thirty-five years old and he’s still living on the Lower East Side, still in the restaurant business, still serving the people he wanted to be. What does Eric do? He manages. Not like Ike Marcus. Ike was young, good-looking, people liked him. Ask him what he did, he wouldn’t say tending bar. He was going places—until two street kids stepped up to him and Eric one night and pulled a gun. At least, that’s Eric’s version. In Lush Life, Richard Price tears the shiny veneer off the “new” New York to show us the hidden cracks, the underground networks of control and violence beneath the glamour. Lush Life is an Xray of the street in the age of no broken windows and “quality of life” squads, from a writer whose “tough, gritty brand of social realism . . . reads like a movie in prose” (Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times).;Samaritan  After a lucrative television writing career comes to an abrupt end, ex–high school teacher Ray Mitchell returns to the New Jersey city of his birth—to rethink his life, reconnect with his teenage daughter and to spread the wealth on the housing project that reared him. He begins teaching again, embarks on an affair with a married woman from the old neighborhood and becomes a mentor to a former student recently released from jail. Then, disaster: he is found beaten nearly to death in his own apartment. He knows who did it, but he’s not talking, and he refuses to press charges. It is up to Detective Nerese Ammons—a childhood acquaintance from the projects—to get Ray to tell her what happened. Alternating between investigations of the people in Ray’s life most likely to do him harm and listening to his fevered ramblings about their shared past as he slips in and out of consciousness, Nerese is charged not only with uncovering the perpetrator of this assault but with understanding what kind of victim is more afraid of the truth than of his potential murderer. The Washington Post Book World has hailed Richard Price as having “the best equipment a novelist can have—that combination of muscularity, insight and compassion we might call heart.” Samaritan is an electrifying story of crime and punishment, of character and place, of children and their keepers—a novel of literary suspense that explores what happens when, caught up in the drama of one’s own generosity, too little is given, too little is understood and the results threaten to prove both tragic and deadly.;Yes, the user question needs a clarification request.

90;90;90;90;90;90;528;0;Who is reponsible for influencing whitneyhoustonvevo? <EOS> Mary j. blige <EOS> Who was the supporting artist who performed with the person?;whitneyhoustonVEVO  Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963 – February 11, 2012) was an American singer, actress, producer, and model. In 2009, Guinness World Records cited her as the most awarded female act of all time. Houston is one of pop music's best-selling music artists of all-time, with an estimated 170–200 million records sold worldwide. She released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum or gold certification. Houston's crossover appeal on the popular music charts, as well as her prominence on MTV, starting with her video for How Will I Know, influenced several African American women artists who follow in her footsteps. Wikipedia: Whitney Houston All My Love For You Thanks to hit singles like Saving All My Love For You and I Wanna Dance With Somebody, Whitney Houston became one of the biggest female pop music stars of the 1980s and 1990s. Her first four albums, released between 1985 and 1992, amassed global sales in excess of 86 million copies. She was born on August 9, 1963 in Newark, New Jersey to John and Emily “Cissy” Houston (née Drinkard). Her father was an Army serviceman and her mother's vocal group, the Sweet Inspirations, sang backup for Aretha Franklin. Houston began singing in church as a child. While still in high school, she sang backup for Chaka Khan and Lou Rawls and modeled for fashion magazines. At age 19 she signed with Arista Records, whose president, Clive Davis, groomed the gospel-based singer for crossover pop success. Her debut album, Whitney Houston (1985), yielded three number one singles: “Greatest Love of All,” which became her signature, “Saving All My Love for You”, and “How Will I Know.” Whitney (1987) delivered four more number ones and earned Houston her first Grammy Award (for the single “I Wanna Dance with Somebody”). In 1992 she married singer Bobby Brown (divorced 2007) and made her motion-picture debut in The Bodyguard, the film featured her rendition of Dolly Parton's “I Will Always Love You,” which stayed at number one for 14 weeks. The film sound track dominated the Grammys the following year, and Houston won the awards for album of the year, record of the year, and best female pop vocal performance. In the mid-1990s she continued acting, in films such as Waiting to Exhale (1995) and The Preacher's Wife (1996), and the sound track of each film generated hit singles for her. In 1998 Houston released My Love Is Your Love, which did not sell as well as previous efforts but was praised by the critics and earned her another Grammy Award. In 2000 she signed a new multi-album contract with Arista for $100 million, but personal difficulties soon overshadowed her recording career. Houston's relationship with Brown provided fodder for the tabloids, as did her health and financial issues. Her 2002 album, Just Whitney, was a personal response to her detractors, but its sales were disappointing compared with earlier efforts. Other than a lackluster holiday album, One Wish (2003), Houston spent subsequent years in a state of virtual retirement. In February 2009 she began a comeback effort with a four-song set at Clive Davis's pre-Grammy Awards gala. The performance was greeted warmly, and in June Houston announced that an album of new material would be available later that year. I Look to You was released in August to positive reviews, and standout songs included the up-tempo “Million Dollar Bill” (penned by Alicia Keys) and the title track, a slow-building ballad written by R. Kelly. Sources: Wikipedia, Biography, Who2 See also R.I.P. Whitney Houston: 1963 - 2012;Mary j. blige  Official YouTube channel of Mary J.

Created by Simon Cowell, the show began in 2004 and has since aired annually from August/September until December. The show is produced by FremantleMedia's Thames and Cowell's production company SycoTV.

The X Factor refers to the undefinable something that makes for star quality. The show was devised as a replacement for the highly successful Pop Idol, which was put on indefinite hiatus after its second series, largely because Cowell, who was a judge on Pop Idol, wished to launch a show to which he owned the television rights. The perceived similarity between the two shows later became the subject of a legal dispute. The original judging panel consisted of Louis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Cowell.

The property, in an area then called Seven Mile Brook, is described in a township survey by Samuel Weston: To Henry McKenney Jr. the Island A. settled before the year 1784. Containing 167 acres. He prays to have the privilege of purchasing the overplus of 100 acres - as it is improved in various parts. He paying what the same might have been worth in a state of Nature. Henry II is living with his son on an island in the Kennebec River called Weston Island in modern times. Notably, Benedict Arnold and his army were the first non-native squatters on the island, they camped there on their way up the Kennebec River in 1775. A History of the Kennebec Valley states: But to return to Arnold's march up the Kennebec. About the middle of October [1775] the army left Old Point and moved up the valley. As the army passed up the river it rested upon Weston's Island. Arriving at Carratunk Falls, the main army reached the point were they were to leave the Kennebec River and transport their munitions across to Dead River, a distance of about fifteen miles, through a thick forest. Weston's Island was first called McKenney Island. The road the army cleared up the Kennebec River was probably used by Henry to find and settle the island sometime before 1784. Henry II buys an improved 200 acre lot right across the river from his son. Mr. Weston, the surveyor, says: ...This land has had a family thereon till very lately - McKenney purchased it & the family removed & said McKenney now lives with his son on the adjoining island - but expects to remove thereupon in the spring. ... I suspect the family Weston was referring to was in fact Henry II's own children. We know that Charles and William were living close by and signed a petition in 1789. We can also conclude that Rober Rogers was an immediate neighbor of Charles and William when they signed the petition. And we know from the Weston survey that Rober Rogers was Henry II's immediate neighbor after he purchased the land. from the: 1791_Weston_Field_Book Henry at 22 years old settled on a large island in the Kennebec River near Madison, Maine.
