Ἄτλας) was the primordial Titan who supported the heavens. Atlas was the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia[1] or Klyménē (Κλυμένη):[2] Now Iapetus took to wife the neat-ankled maid Clymene, daughter of Ocean, and went up with her into one bed. And she bare him a stout-hearted son, Atlas: also she bare very glorious Menoetius and clever Prometheus, full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus.[3] Hyginus emphasises the primordial nature of Atlas by making him the son of Aether and Gaia.[4] In contexts where a Titan and a Titaness are assigned each of the seven planetary powers, Atlas is paired with Phoebe and governs the moon.[5] He had three brothers — Prometheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius.[6] En la mitología griega, Atlas (griego antiguo Ἄτλας, el portador de τλάω / tláô, oso, oso ) es un Titan.. Fue el hijo de Japet y Themis (o Clymène o Asia), y el hermano de Prometeo, Epimeteo y Menoetius.

Ἄτλας) was the primordial Titan who supported the heavens. Atlas was the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia[1] or Klyménē (Κλυμένη):[2] Now Iapetus took to wife the neat-ankled maid Clymene, daughter of Ocean, and went up with her into one bed. And she bare him a stout-hearted son, Atlas: also she bare very glorious Menoetius and clever Prometheus, full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus.[3] Hyginus emphasises the primordial nature of Atlas by making him the son of Aether and Gaia.[4] In contexts where a Titan and a Titaness are assigned each of the seven planetary powers, Atlas is paired with Phoebe and governs the moon.[5] He had three brothers — Prometheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius.[6] En la mitología griega, Atlas (griego antiguo Ἄτλας, el portador de τλάω / tláô, oso, oso ) es un Titan.. Fue el hijo de Japet y Themis (o Clymène o Asia), y el hermano de Prometeo, Epimeteo y Menoetius.
