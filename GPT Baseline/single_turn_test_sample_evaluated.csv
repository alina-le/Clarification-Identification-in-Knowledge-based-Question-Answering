Work, play, love, hate, trust and betrayal are on the headlines every episode.;Argon  Argon is a chemical element with symbol Ar and atomic number 18. It is in group 18 of the periodic table and is a noble gas. Argon is the third most common gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.93%, making it approximately 23.8 times as abundant as the next most common atmospheric gas, carbon dioxide, and more than 500 times as abundant as the next most common noble gas, neon. Nearly all of this argon is radiogenic argon-40 derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust. In the universe, argon-36 is by far the most common argon isotope, being the preferred argon isotope produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovas. The name argon is derived from the Greek word αργον, neuter singular form of αργος meaning lazy or inactive, as a reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions. The complete octet in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements. Its triple point temperature of 83.8058 K is a defining fixed point in the International Temperature Scale of 1990.

The east side of the future national park was purchased by the federal government from the Blackfoot Confederacy in 1895 during the second term of President Cleveland. According to the United States Board on Geographic Names, the mountain is named for the former president.;Mount Cleveland  Mount Cleveland is a nearly symmetrical stratovolcano on the western end of Chuginadak Island, which is part of the Islands of Four Mountains just west of Umnak Island in the Fox Islands of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Mt. Cleveland is 1,730 m high, and one of the most active of the 75 or more volcanoes in the larger Aleutian Arc. Aleutian natives named the island after their fire goddess, Chuginadak, who they believed inhabited the volcano. In 1894 a team from the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey visited the island and gave Mount Cleveland its current name, after then-president Grover Cleveland. One of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc, Cleveland has erupted at least 22 times in the last 230 years. A VEI 3 eruption in 1944 produced the arc's only known volcanic fatality.

The first storm of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season, Adrian developed on May 17, just two days after the official start of the season, several hundred miles south-southeast of Mexico. Tracking in an atypical northwestward direction, the storm gradually intensified. On May 19, the storm reached its peak strength as a minimal hurricane with winds of 80 mph. Not long after reaching this intensity, the storm abruptly weakened. By the morning of May 20, the system had weakened to a minimal tropical storm and turned due west. Later that day, the storm made landfall along the Gulf of Fonseca in Honduras before dissipating several hours later.;Hurricane Adrian  Hurricane Adrian was an intense, albeit short-lived early-season category 4 hurricane that took part during the 2011 Pacific hurricane season. Adrian originated from an area of disturbed weather which had developed during the course of early June, off the Pacific coast of Mexico. On June 7, it acquired a sufficiently organized structure with deep convection to be classified as a tropical cyclone, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated it as Tropical Depression One-E, the first one of 2011. It further strengthened to be upgraded into a tropical storm later that day. Adrian moved rather slowly, briefly recurving northward after being caught in the steering winds. After steady intensification, it was upgraded into a hurricane on June 9.

He has also appeared in various novel, comic book and video game adaptations of the series. Played by actor Seth Green, he was introduced in the season two episode Inca Mummy Girl.;Oz  The Land of Oz is a fantasy region containing four lands under the rule of one monarch. It was first introduced in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum, one of many fantasy countries that he created for his books. It achieved a greater popularity than any of his other lands attained, and after four years, he returned to it. The land was described and expanded upon in the Oz Books. An attempt to cut off the production of the series with The Emerald City of Oz, by ending the story with Oz being isolated from the rest of the world, did not succeed owing to readers' reactions and Baum's financial need to write successful books. The canonical demonym for Oz is Ozite. The term appears in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, The Road to Oz, and The Emerald City of Oz. Elsewhere in the canon, Ozmie is also used. In the sequel to the MGM film, Journey Back to Oz, Ozonian is used. The term Ozian appears in the script for the Royal Shakespeare Company's stage adaptation of the MGM movie and in the non-canonical modern work Wicked. Ozmite was used in Reilly & Lee marketing in the 1920s, which has suggested to some critics that Ozmie may have been a typographical error.;The user question does not need a clarification request.

In the Odyssey, Athena appears on earth disguised as everything from a little girl to Odysseus’s friend Mentor to Telemachus. Proteus, the Old Man of the Sea whom Menelaus describes in Book 4, can assume any form, even water and fire, to escape capture. Circe, on the other hand, uses her powers to change others, turning an entire contingent of Odysseus’s crew into pigs with a tap of her wand.From the first line of the epic, Homer explains that his story is about a “man of twists and turns” (1.1). Quick, clever, and calculating, Odysseus is a natural master of disguise, and the plot of the epic often turns on his deception. By withholding his true identity from the Cyclops and using the alias “Nobody,” for example, Odysseus is able to save himself and his crew. But by revealing his name at the end of this episode, Odysseus ends up being dogged by the god Poseidon. His beggar disguise allows him to infiltrate his palace and set up the final confrontation with the suitors. It also allows Homer to distinguish those who truly love Odysseus—characters like Eurycleia, Penelope, and even his dog, Argos, begin to recognize their beloved king even before he sheds his disguise.;Disguises  Admiral Mallory is taken aback when undercover agent Jack Warren reveals that Deanna Kincaid, the Admiral's sister-in-law, may be the American traitor working with the KGB. Lt. Simon Adams battles the Navy over his flying suspension. Once he is re-instated the memory of his wingman's death overcomes him during a carrier landing.

The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value, and, perhaps, a standard of deferred payment. Any item or verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered money. Money is historically an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity money, but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on fiat money. Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without intrinsic use value as a physical commodity. It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender, that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for all debts, public and private. Such laws in practice cause fiat money to acquire the value of any of the goods and services that it may be traded for within the nation that issues it.

Originally gaff-rigged, modern schooners typically carry a Bermuda rig. Such vessels were first used by the Dutch in the 16th or 17th century. They were further developed in North America from the early 18th century, and came into extensive use in New England. The most common type, with two masts, were popular in trades requiring speed and windward ability, such as slaving, privateering, blockade running, and offshore fishing. In the Chesapeake Bay area several distinctive schooner types evolved, including the Baltimore clipper, bugeye, and pungy. Schooners were popular on both sides of the Atlantic in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, long dominating yacht races such as the America's Cup, but gradually gave way in Europe to the cutter.;Schooner  The building of the schooner Thomas E.

79;79;79;79;79;79;79;107;0;what is brand name of Ganirelix?;Ganirelix  Ganirelix acetate is an injectable competitive gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist. It is primarily used in assisted reproduction to control ovulation. The drug works by blocking the action of GnRH upon the pituitary, thus rapidly suppressing the production and action of LH and FSH. Ganirelix is used in fertility treatment to prevent premature ovulation that could result in the harvesting of eggs that are too immature to be used in procedures such as in vitro fertilisation. GnRH agonists are also sometimes used in reproductive therapy, as well as to treat disorders involving sex-steroid hormones, such as endometriosis. One advantage of using GnRH antagonists is that repeated administration of GnRH agonists results in decreased levels of gonadotropins and sex steroids due to desensitization of the pituitary. This is avoided when using GnRH antagonists such as Ganirelix. The success of Ganirelix in reproductive therapy has been shown to be comparable to that when using GnRH agonists. Ganirelix is derived from GnRH itself, with amino acid substitutions made at positions 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10.;Ganirelix  Ganirelix (Ganirelix Acetate) is used to regulate hormone responses in women undergoing treatment for infertility.;The user question does not need a clarification request.

It is also designated Saturn XV.;Atlas  Atlas (mythology) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia In Greek mythology, Atlas (Eng. /'æt ləs/ Gk. Ἄτλας) was the primordial Titan who supported the heavens. Atlas was the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia[1] or Klyménē (Κλυμένη):[2] Now Iapetus took to wife the neat-ankled maid Clymene, daughter of Ocean, and went up with her into one bed. And she bare him a stout-hearted son, Atlas: also she bare very glorious Menoetius and clever Prometheus, full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus.[3] Hyginus emphasises the primordial nature of Atlas by making him the son of Aether and Gaia.[4] In contexts where a Titan and a Titaness are assigned each of the seven planetary powers, Atlas is paired with Phoebe and governs the moon.[5] He had three brothers — Prometheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius.[6] En la mitología griega, Atlas (griego antiguo Ἄτλας, el portador de τλάω / tláô, oso, oso ) es un Titan..

The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Orthodox Christians. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire, and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. Russia lost the war and the Ottomans gained a twenty-year respite from Russian pressure. The Christians were granted a degree of official equality and the Orthodox gained control of the Christian churches in dispute. The Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia in October 1853 and suffered a major defeat that gave Russia control of the Black Sea. The Russian threat to the Ottoman Empire required control of the Black Sea, and the key was the Russian naval base at Sevastopol, on the Crimean peninsula. The allies realized that if they captured Sevastopol, they would control the Black Sea and win the war.;The Crimean War  During the Crimean War, for the first time, newspaper correspondents were able to provide the public with eye-witness accounts of the scenes of conflict. This book combines such descriptions from The Times of London with a discussion of the war, based on historical scholarship. In addition to the famous accounts submitted by William Howard Russell, all areas of the Black Sea theatre are covered, including the Sea of Azov, the Caucasus and Bulgaria, along with other major theatre of war, the Baltic, where the Admiral and Commander-in-Chief sometimes acted as Times correspondent.
